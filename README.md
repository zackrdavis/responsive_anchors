responsive_anchors
==================

Anchor links when a site is tall and narrow for mobile, pretty links when it's not.

This was originally developed for a WP-based site with four tall columns, side by side on wide screens and vertically stacked for mobile.
Clicking a link in one column/category would display the entire entry, but if that entry was in one of the last three columns on mobile, you'd land at the top of the page and see related but not primary content.
This makes sure anchor links are there to drop you down to the right spot when the columns are stacked, but otherwise disappear.
